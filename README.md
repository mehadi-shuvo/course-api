# Course Review API Project

Welcome to the Course Review API project! This backend application is designed to provide a seamless and secure experience for managing course reviews. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, the project utilizes Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic, TypeScript for enhanced code maintainability, and Mongoose for seamless MongoDB integration. The development workflow is optimized with essential tools and libraries to ensure a modern and efficient experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A robust JavaScript runtime for scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A minimalist web application framework for Node.js with robust features for web and mobile applications.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and reducing errors through static typing.
- **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed for asynchronous environments, providing a schema-based solution for application data.
- **Dotenv:** A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env, simplifying configuration management.
- **Cors:** A middleware for Express.js facilitating Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, ensuring secure communication between frontend and backend.
- **ESLint:** A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript, identifying and fixing common coding issues to ensure code consistency and quality.
- **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter enforcing a consistent coding style, enhancing code readability and collaboration.
- **ts-node-dev:** A development utility for fast and efficient TypeScript development, automatically restarting the server on file changes.
- **Zod:** A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library promoting better type safety and runtime validation.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone [https://github.com/Porgramming-Hero-web-course/l2b2a3-course-review-mehadi-shuvo]`
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Set up environment variables:** Create a .env file based on the provided .env.example. Declare variables for `NODE_ENV`, `PORT`, and `DB_URL`.
4. **Assign values to env variables:** Set `NODE_ENV` to 'development,' use PORT 5000 locally, and assign the MongoDB Atlas DB_URL.
5. **Start the development server:** `npm run start:dev`

Now, you're ready to explore and enhance the Course Review API project with confidence! Feel free to contribute and build amazing features to elevate the project further. If you have any questions or issues, please refer to the documentation or reach out to the project maintainers. Happy coding!
